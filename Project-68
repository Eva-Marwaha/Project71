        consider, canteens must be organized and more efficients than they have been in the past. Online menus
        with photographs of their meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of theiringredients help both students and
        parents make the right nutritional choices. each student or staff member who accesses could be provided
        with a School canteen account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices
        and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering oinline by ticking a box and paying for meals online can  
         eliminate all of the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike.
         Here again, diversity is the key.

    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12"> 1. Accuracy
       humans are prone to error, even if we provide them with supporting computational devices. Automated attendance management systems
      ensure accurate time records and miniminze the inevitable and costly errors with manual data entry. This
      accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate performance and payroll data.
      <br>
      2. Economics
      Have you ever thought that attendance management systems could control costs? It saves money by
      putting an end to innaccurate time reporting, buddy punching, abrenteeium, tardiness, time abuse, and overpayment. As a 
      matter of fact,a study done by the aeslum group fouynd out that large organizations could save up to $1,000
      per employee after implementing automated attendance management systems.
      <br>
      3. Productivity/Efficiency
      monitoring and managing attendance manually  can be a time-consuming, laborious, and expensive affair.
      It takes time to process paper sheets and time cards, create schedules, authorize leave abnd overtime, and create
      payrolls manually. Free up precious administration time with an automated system that does it all for you, from
      keeping track of employee hours to automatically importing information into your payroll system. The
      time and effort saved combined with data accuracy helps in optimizing the use of resources,
      which led to increased productivity and improves profits. And many more like visibility/insights, Hassle free Workflow
